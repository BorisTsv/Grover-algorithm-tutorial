        "Having seen a preview of the divide-and-conquer QAOA in [Lab 1](1_Overview-Max-Cut-with-QAOA.ipynb), we are ready to dive into the details of the algorithm here. In this lab, we will introduce the main steps of the divide-and-conquer QAOA algorithm through an example graph that requires only one divide-and-conquer iteration. This will prepare us for Lab 3 in which we will iterate these steps recursively and in parallel to handle much larger problem instances.  \n",

        "**Relationship to circuit cutting:** From one point of view, the divide-and-conquer QAOA divides a graph into smaller graphs, and the max cut problems on those subgraphs are solved. Later these subgraph solutions are merged together for a max cut approximation of the parent graph. We see this viewpoint in work by [Esposito and Danzig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17383), [Guerreschi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07813), [Li et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02302), [Liers et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/3527603794.ch4),  [Ponce et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00494), [Yue et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05062.pdf), and [Zhao et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11762).  Another way of positioning the divide-and-conquer QAOA is as a circuit cutting protocol.  *Circuit cutting* is a technique of dividing a quantum circuit into subcircuits with fewer gates and qubits. After running these circuits, post-processing stitches the results together to get an approximation of the execution of the original circuit.  This is the viewpoint presented in the work of [Cattelan and Yarkoni](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03037) and of [Bechtold et al](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acf59c). As you complete the lab, we encourage you to think about how these two viewpoints are related.\n",

        "In this lab, we implement the divide-and-conquer QAOA in three steps:\n",
        "1. **Divide:**  The divide-and-conquer algorithm divides the initial graph into small enough subgraphs, recursively if necessary.\n",
        "2. **Conquer:** QAOA is executed to find max-cut approximations of the smaller subgraphs, in parallel when possible.\n",
        "3. **Merge:** To stitch together the subgraph solutions into a solution of their parent graph, we consider the border subgraph generated by the edges between the subgraphs.  We define a new graph based on a different vertex set, which we will call the merger graph. This graph captures the interactions between border vertices. Finally, to merge the subgraph solutions together for an approximately optimal solution to the larger graph, we employ QAOA to the merger graph invoking a new cost function.\n",

This graph has so many vertices and edges that the circuit depth and width of the QAOA max cut circuit would likely be too large to run and/or simulate on most systems. In particular we would need 30 qubits for the max cut QAOA circuit of this graph. Therefore, `sampleGraph2` is a good candidate to experiment with the divide-and-conquer QAOA.

The example in this lab is small enough that we only have to subdivide the initial graph once to generate a few subgraphs, each of which is sufficiently small to quickly estimate their max cut. Later on in Lab 3, we'll consider a larger graph that will require multiple subdivisions.\n",

        "How should we divide our graph into smaller subgraphs? As we saw in Lab 1, the edges between the subgraphs can introduce some complications when merging together subgraph max cut solutions into an approximate solution of the parent graph. Therefore, the algorithm may run better if the number of edges between subgraphs is limited. In general, finding an optimal partitioning of this kind is thought to be NP-complete ([Newman and Girvan, 2004](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0308217)). However, there are many heuristic algorithms that produce decent partitions for our purposes. For example, the Louvain algorithm was used in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05062) and [this one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07813) for quantum divide-and-conquer approaches to the Max Cut problem, and [Angel Rodriquez-Fernandez and co-authors](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3197/8/3/75) analyzed five other clustering algorithms to improve the Goemans-Williamson classical approximation for Max-Cut. For this tutorial, we will use a community-detection-based partition that was favorably compared to a random partition in the [QAOA-in-QAOA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11762). This community-detection-based partition was proposed by [Clauset, Newman, and Moore](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0408187) and implemented in NetworkX with the function `greedy_modularity_communities`. To read more about this classical algorithm, refer to the [NetworkX documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.community.modularity_max.greedy_modularity_communities.html)."

        "Finding an optimal swap schedule depends on the edges in the `borderGraph`. We can visualize this as a new graph, which we'll call the `mergerGraph`.  The vertices in this graph represent the subgraphs.  We'll label the nodes `G0`, `G1`, `G2`, `G3`, and `G4` to indicate their corresponding subgraph. Two nodes `Gi` and `Gj` in `mergerGraph` will be connected if there is at least one edge in `borderGraph` between a node in `Gi` and a node in `Gj`.  We're losing a bit of information (e.g. the number of edges between two subgraphs) through this definition, but we'll recover that information shortly, when we add a weight to the edges of this graph.  There is a lot going here! So, let's first take a look at the `mergerGraph` without weights.\n"

More importantly we lose information about the number of edges between subgraphs that are in the unaltered cut and the number of edges that are not in that cut. This information is important in deciding whether or not to change the colors of the vertices in one of the subgraphs.  We'll record this information as penalities of edges between the nodes in `mergerGraph`.  For every edge in `borderGraph` connecting subgraph `Gi` to `Gj`, we'll add 1 to the `penalty` of the edge `(Gi,Gj)` in `mergerGraph`if the edge was in the unaltered cut and we'll subtract 1 from the `penalty` if the edge was not in the unaltered cut. The idea being that if we flip the colors of subgraph `Gi` we may lose some edges and gain others in the new cut. A positive penalty would indicate that there are more edges between subgraphs `Gi` and `Gj` that would be removed from the cut than gained when we swap the colors of one of the subgraphs. So a negative penalty between vertices can be thought of as a gain of edges in the cut from flipping one of the subgraph colorings.  \n",

There are $5$ edges connecting a vertex in `G1` with one in `G2`: $(5,12)$, $(24, 12)$, $(4,25)$, $(24, 26)$, and $(18,11)$.  Notice that one of these edges is colored green (and hence in unaltered cut) and the other 4 are not.  This means that if were to alter the coloring that determined the unaltered cut by flipping the colors of either the nodes in `G1` or the nodes in `G2` we would lose one edge (the green one) but gain four edges in the new modified cut.  The penalty for changing the color of one of these two subgraphs would be $1-4 =-3$ (i.e., we would have a net gain of $3$ edges)."
